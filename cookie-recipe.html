    <h3>History of cookies</h3>
    <p>Most people don't know the complicated past of the cookie.</p>
    <p><em>The word cookie originally came from the Dutch keokje, meaning "little cake." In addition, the Dutch first popularized cookies in the United States. The British took a liking to them in the 19th century, incorporating them into their daily tea service and calling them biscuits or sweet buns, as they do in Scotland.</em></p>
